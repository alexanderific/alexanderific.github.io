Alex Barson is a software engineer who has architected & developed systems in the academic, insurance, and government spaces.
Though most of his expertise lies in the JVM stack, there is just nothing like dabbling in some of the bleeding edge languages like elixir, rust, or node. He is passionate about service oriented architecture and build automation, and loves to talk about it.

Hailing from the mitten of America, Alex lives in Lansing, Michigan with his wife, son, and pot-bellied pig.
